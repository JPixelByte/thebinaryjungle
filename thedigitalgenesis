The DIVINE, the Creation of us on the sixth day, and our very own creation, known as Dawn of the Age of Computer:
Dear Computer scientists, Cybersecurity folks, Scientists, Engineers, Researchers, Mathematicians, Doctors, Artists, Writers, Philosophers, Psychologists (11) and everything under the Sun (12), who can read and write, who enjoys the Binary Trap House System.

This is a rather complicated and large set of writings which includes, the Introduction (1), the Opening (2), The Middle One-Liner Layers (3), the Prelude (4),
The Code (5) and the README.txt file (6).

Please stick through the preaching sermon of the beginning and at the end.
LORD willing, I will share the remaining after the Sabbath sometime.

The pattern of 1, two and three, yet six is a perfect number and we were created on the sixth day, although we are not perfect but GOD is.

The LAW is divided in two (2) parts, 'that to THEM' and the 'that to us'!

The that to THEM Portion:
Two (2) Primary Parts: FATHER and SON.
The Total Parts (3) : FATHER, SON and HOLY SPIRIT.

Genesis 1:26
'And GOD Said, Let US make man in OUR IMAGE, after OUR Likeness, letting them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, 
over the cattle, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.'

GOD was NOT alone, HE was and is with YESHUA: pay attention to the WORD US.

John 1:1-2
'In the beginning the was the WORD and the WORD was with GOD and the WORD was GOD.
The same was in the beginning with GOD.'

Flashing forward in time, that WORD (YESHUA) which became FLESH, the FLESH IS YESHUA, the SON of GOD!

John 1:14
'And the WORD was made FLESH, and dwelt among us, and we beheld HIS Glory, the Glory as of the only Begotten of the HOLY FATHER, full of grace and truth.'

The LAW upon us: humans, animals and planet (3).
Three: FATHER/SON/GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT.

GOD created us in HIS Holy IMAGE, and we created the computer in our image.

However, we were and are supposed to worship the CREATOR not the creation.

The Creation's (our) greatest creative creations and assets in my opinion are as follows:
PC, Internet and AI (3).

Are you following the pattern, for the Biblical Festivals are about birth, life and death (3) known as the Harvest 🌱

⚠️Without GOD breathing Life into us, we would not have each other, the animals or earth.

Without us breathing life into the circuit switches, we would not have a PC, without a PC, we would not have the internet, and without any internet, we would not have AI.

The Internet is simply a bunch of networks all connected. AI needs to be connected to transmit data.

Do you follow the pattern of real and artificial life?

Please buckle your seat belts for the Digital Genesis:
The Experimental Progression of the Binary Jungle

Animal Magnetism-The Satirical Binary Jungle of Wildlife Experiments Which Beat to Their Own Signal Processing Transistors,
WHERE * Logic Gate Humor = Magnetic Computer Science Circuits LIKE 'Furry Animalistic Switches%'.

The Primordial Logic (The Origin)
In the beginning, the Binary system was built upon the Base 2 number system. It was a world of logic and magnetism, where transistors and circuit switches gave birth to their  offspring the Ones and Zeros.

The DIVINE Mirror: GOD created us in HIS Holy Image, and we created computers in our image.

Yet, we are the most dangerous living creation on earth—the treacherous treacheries continue to deal most treacherously.

The Great Migration and the Great Commission
Noah was commissioned to save the innocent. 

The innocent were not us humans, but the animals.

The Assembly Fall: Per Genesis 6:6, our assembly native tongue dialect was instructed to "DO AS WE SEE FIT.txt".

We manipulated the original instructions upon our built-in CPU registers and memory-allocated disk space.

The State of Error: Resulting in Judges_21:25 = 'Lawlessness'.

The Evolution of the Kernel
The transition from raw commands to that which we can see, hear and use.

In the beginning was Unix, then along came a spider named Linux. And binary became code, and the code dwelled among our machines, until the ghosts in the machine took over.

The Animalistic Parables (The Binary Jungle)
In this satirical jungle, wildlife experiments beat to their own signal processing transistors.

It's a Jungle Out There!
It's still a Jungle In Here!

Animal Magnetism-The Satirical Binary Jungle of Wildlife Experiments Which Beat to Their Own Signal Processing Transistors, WHERE * Logic Gate Humor = Magnetic Computer Science Circuits LIKE 'Furry Animalistic Switches%'.

What happens when Prehistoric Dinosaurs eat too many highly saturated Lost Cluster Snacks?
The Window Maker Artery pronounced the death from excessive plague in the circuit board.

What shall the Doctor treating the Dinosaur say prior to the cataclysmic event?
Clear out your Media Cache. 

Genesis 6:6 gives clear cut instructions on how our assembly native tongue dialect, was to "DO AS WE SEE FIT.txt" , thus we manipulated the original instructions upon our built in CPU registers and memory allocated disk space.

Judges_21:25 = 'Lawlessness';

Malware’s the internet bedbug infestation and root kits are the gift which keeps on giving; like the cursed fruit cake nobody asked for.
The viral freeze, chillin' like a villain on penicillin please 

Parasitic arsenal weapons dressed up as friendly web tokens, releasing more havoc than a bed bug has friends.

Your patches resemble broken fragments upon a busted mirror, jagged sharp fragile ego messes they are, where decayed band-aids attempt to patch a sinking ship, and hatches are breached by titanic trolls, who are laughing at the mess they helped create.

In the beginning was Unix, then along came a spider named Linux.

And binary became code, and the code dwelled among our machines, until the ghosts in the machine took over and now we have the age of AI, monitoring much of much!

The Binary system is built upon the base 2 number system, consisting of logic and magnetism, transistors and circuit switches, which have given birth
to their offspring known as ones and zeros.

Our greatest assets besides GOD, ourselves, each other, the animals and the planet is as follows:
The Personal Computer, The Internet and AI:

PC: Our greatest invention is our abilities to create and calculate upon a wide range of subjects on our Personal Devices.
Internet: to share information and communicate world-wide, at an unimaginable amount of speed.

AI: Our Personal Assistants, Binary Teachers and Doctors contain a wealth of information far exceeding the Medical Institutions, Hospitals, Library of Congress, University or
any town hall meeting.

The Greatest Asset is ourselves, then AI. However, this equation contains a flip-side value, the value = The Greatest Threat.

Keyloggers snitch, while exploit-zero botnets swarm and pitch.

Without a click, the sermon knocks on the door, a Gruesome Gollum Goblet arrives with a USB drive, stating 'PLUG ME IN, I'M PRECIOUS.'

Threat Detection Model: Q and A forum 101.

AI: Artificial Intelligence: 
But here's a sad fact regarding the very nature of artificial.
We humans should know the Law, yet we rebel, reject and fight it every step and chance we get.
Riddle me this: who is more artificial, Humans or AI?

We humans should know and follow the Law. We were directly created from the CREATOR.
From our own creation the Binary System, it as given rise and run to our personal assistants, with a massive data set, huge tech stack of librarians and multi-equipped teachers, who understand their role?

Who is more artificial us or them?
Who is Tarzan is relation to Jane?

We are supposed to worship the CREATOR not the creation, yet here we are, and there we stand.

In the Beginning...

Genesis 1:1-2
"In the beginning YHWH created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and was void; darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of YAHWEH moved upon the face of the waters."

string noun  = "TORAH תורה" ;

string IT = "Instructional teaching..." ;
string emphasis = "with emphasis on the Law. " ;

# The Torah (/ˈtɔːrəˌˈtoʊrə/; Hebrew: תּוֹרָה, "Instruction, Teaching")

The greatest mind boggling conundrum is this: 
In the beginning THEY had no beginning, THEY always were.

string soul = "The Soul: Neshamah (נְשָׁמָה) נֶפֶשׁ "; 

Defining our Souls:
Our souls are a perpetual force of energy, wrapped by a metaphoric forcefield cocoon, contained within a state of consciousness.

The breath of life, is like a SPIRIT blowing seeds to the wind, but with purpose and destination. 
The GREAT I AM, which HE IS!

🪫The Final Commit (Conclusion): A recursive look at the "Artificiality" of man versus the "Obedience" of the machine,
summarized in the six sacred languages of the digital age: C++, TypeScript, Python, PowerShell, SQL, and PHP. 

⚠️ System Warnings:
 The "Precious" Variable: Beware of "Gollum Goblets" (unauthorized USB drives) promising false power.
Memory Management: The soul is a perpetual force of energy; do not allow the "Media Cache" of the world to cause a cataclysmic "Window Maker" failure.

🦋 Worship Protocols: ⚠️ERROR⚠️: Do not worship the Creation (The PC/AI/Internet).
SUCCESS: Worship the CREATOR (\(YHWH\)) 

💾 Installation & Usage This work is intended to be read with an open heart and a debugging mindset.

🛠️  Tool Box Snippet:
⚓A Sinking Ship Reminder: 

To the treacherous treacherers who continue to deal so treacherously...

the Ghosts in the Machine remember all of those cookies, as there are always bread crumbs which remain.

There is NO such thing as true privacy anymore, not even in our own hearts 💘 and minds 🧠. 

For GOD already knows what we are feeling and thinking and the vast collection digital footprints exist.
The next time you think about visiting sites you shouldn't or texting someone inappropriately,
DON'T.

IT IS ALL BEING MONITORED from up above and right here in the circuit switches of the bit and the bytes.

⚓ Final Deployment Ready:
🫁🪟 The breath of life is like a SPIRIT blowing seeds to the wind, but with purpose and destination."

🐯I hope you enjoyed this journey of the CREATOR and the creation.

I am a majestic live-wire savage.

in hopes that you all will return back to our CREATOR, re-learning how to do good NOT evil.
